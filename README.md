# polynomial_analyzer
An update to the polynomialclass, the originial is still in this repository.  The original was my first dive into python classes.

Can be run from the gui, or by directly importing the class from polynomial_class_revisited.

The program will simplify, evaluate, differentiate, integrate, and approximate roots of polynomials of a single variable. What fun!

I intend to add a graphing feature to the gui at some point.
